        I'm a Unity game developer with a focus on real-time multiplayer systems, backend integration, and gameplay programming. Iâ€™ve worked on multiple commercially successful mobile games, including large-scale multiplayer titles with tens of millions of downloads globally.

            My strengths lie in building scalable systems using technologies like Photon Quantum, Nakama, Firebase, and PlayFab, as well as developing custom Unity tools that improve workflow efficiency and content production. I'm currently open to new opportunities where I can contribute to technically ambitious and creatively driven game projects.

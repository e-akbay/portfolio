    <h2>Wakeset Island</h2>
     <p>
        Wakeset Island is a forward rendering demo/scene to demonstrate the use of multiple combined render effects working together in a 3D landscape. Using C++ and modern OpenGL, Wakeset Island served as a great test-bed for trying out some new and interesting rendering techniques and see how to incorporate the combination of these render techniques such that they work well together. 
    </p>
       
    <p>
       Seeing as a large list of render techniques have to work together it is especially important to focus on maintaining a solid and high framerate, regardless of camera conditions. Wakeset Island thus also features several high-level optimization techniques to maintain a steady framerate.

     <p>
        I'm the sole author of <a href="http://learnopengl.com" target="_blank">learnopengl.com</a>, a polished little website that provides an extensive online tutorial set for modern OpenGL since 2014. The tutorials are geared towards both beginning and more experienced graphics programmers and aim to make relatively complex topics easier to understand. Originally meant to be an addition to some of the other online OpenGL tutorials, it now is rated among the best OpenGL tutorials on the web.
    </p>
       
    <p>
        The tutorials are organized in a linear fashion, teaching anyone interested in graphics programming the basics from <em>shaders</em> to <em>coordinate systems</em> up to more advanced tutorials like <em>instanced rendering</em>, <em>gamma correction</em> and <em>deferred shading</em>. Due to popular request I've also converted all of the website's content to an e-book which you can find <a href="http://learnopengl.com/book/offline%20learnopengl.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h2>Voidt</h2>
    <p>
        Voidt is the solo effort of aiming to develop a relatively simple, but performant game engine and game in C/C++ without the use of any libraries, including a graphics API like OpenGL. Voidt currently contains  software-based rendering, custom window management code with back-buffer memory, advanced memory management, SIMD-based mathematics and much more as inspired by the <a href="http://handmadehero.org" target="_blank">Handmade Hero</a> series; basically as low-level as one can get without having to write one's own operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project is halted in development with finished media materials, but source code access to its current state can be found on <a href="https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/Voidt-ongoing-" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I aim to only showcase finished projects in this portfolio, but seeing the relevance in low-level programming and engine-level optimizations I still deem this significant enough to post.
